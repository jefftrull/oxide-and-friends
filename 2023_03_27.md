# Oxide and Friends: March 27th, 2023

## Get You a State Machine for Great Good

We've been hosting a live show weekly on Mondays at 5p for about an hour,
and recording them all; here is
[the recording from March 27th, 2023](https://youtu.be/7RR6hFE_jDU).

In addition to
[Bryan Cantrill](https://mastodon.social/@bcantrill) and
[Adam Leventhal](https://mastodon.social/@ahl),
we were joined by Oxide colleague,
Andrew Stone.

Some of the topics we hit on, in the order that we hit them:

- [tui-rs](https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs)
- [Crossterm](https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm)
- [Topic](link)
- [@M:SS](link into recording)
  *Leventhal's Conundrum*
- PRs needed!

If we got something wrong or missed something, please file a PR!
Our next show will likely be on Monday at 5p Pacific Time on our Discord
server; stay tuned to our Mastodon feeds for details, or [subscribe to this

love to have you join us, as we always love to hear from new speakers!
